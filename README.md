🏦 Loan Classification ML Model
📌 Overview
This project applies Logistic Regression to classify loan applicants as either genuine or fraudulent. It aims to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions during the loan approval process.

📊 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Logistic Regression model training

Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification metrics

Clear and interpretable results for decision-making

🧠 Model
Logistic Regression is used due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification problems. The model outputs probabilities that are thresholded to classify applicants.
